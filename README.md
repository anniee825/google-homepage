This project was to create a webpage that looks similarily to the Google Homepage. When creating this project, I had to play around with positioning different divs and adjusting their display/position properties in order to make the layout of the page. I've always struggled with positioning CSS items how I want so this was nice practice. In addition, I had to refresh up on using position: absolute and position: relative in order to position the icons within the search bar. I struggled with the icons in the search bar for a long time. I had a hard time trying to find the correct photo icons of the microphone,app, and magnifying glass but was introduced to ionicons.com by a kind person which really helped. I did have to inspect the elements on google's official page for some of the display properties in order to create the most similar design properties. This project was very good practice and hopefully I'll learn how to position items better in the upcoming projects. I'll probably try to learn more flexbox and CSS grid for positioning.
